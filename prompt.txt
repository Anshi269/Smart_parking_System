)  these are just example insights now u dont have to work together (for now just idea to give u ) to check and genrrate that insights (like that) together   first of all if talk about  occupancy  check  that by registerd slots on that duration and just show the percentage occupied  on zone  tabs ( on zone selction page ) if a person still goes to any zone where it is comparatively more filled than another then when usr click on slot  just ( a messge hover from that slot to tell or suggest comparatively less ocupied zone ( least occupied for that time ) .  so just the flow is all dependign on time selected by user to suggest occupency ( only from registed users -  currently autogenerated ( u have to make ( mentioned above ) ) later from database
