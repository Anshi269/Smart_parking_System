# 🔧 Fixes & New Features - v1.2.1

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixed

### Issue: Occupancy Changing Randomly
**Problem:** Every time you clicked or selected a spot, the occupancy percentages and red/green slot positions would change randomly.

**Root Cause:** The booking system was regenerating random bookings on every app interaction.

**Solution:** 
1. **Fixed random seed** - Now uses `seed=42` to generate consistent bookings
2. **Session-level caching** - BookingSystem initialized once and stored in `st.session_state`
3. **Persistent data** - Bookings remain the same throughout your session

**Result:** ✅ Occupancy stays consistent until you change the hour or complete a booking

## ✨ New Feature: Smart Spot Recommendations

### What It Does

When you select a parking spot in a **busy zone** (>60% occupied), the system now shows an intelligent recommendation for a better alternative.

### Example

```
You select: Spot 15 in Zone A (75% occupied)

💡 Smart Recommendation:

Your selected zone Zone A is 75% occupied.

Consider Spot 12 in Zone D instead:
- Only 45% occupied (30% less crowded)
- 14 spots available
- Distance to exit: 8.5m

You can still book your current selection, but this spot 
might be easier to find!

[🚀 Switch to Spot 12 in Zone D]
```

### How It Works

```
1. You select a spot in a busy zone
   ↓
2. System checks: Is zone >60% occupied?
   ↓
3. Finds least occupied zone at your selected hour
   ↓
4. Checks: Is it 15%+ better?
   ↓
5. Finds BEST spot in better zone:
   - Filters available spots
   - Sorts by proximity to exit
   - Selects closest
   ↓
6. Shows recommendation with details
   ↓
7. One-click button to switch automatically
```

### Intelligent Selection

The system recommends the **BEST** spot, not just any spot:
- ✅ Available at your selected time
- ✅ **Closest to exit** in the better zone
- ✅ In the **least crowded** zone
- ✅ Significant improvement (>15% less occupancy)

### User Benefits

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Random suggestions | Smart, data-driven recommendations |
| "Try another zone" | "Try Spot X in Zone Y - 8.5m from exit" |
| Manual navigation | One-click auto-switch |
| No comparison | Shows occupancy difference |

## 📊 Testing Checklist

To verify the fixes work:

### Test 1: Occupancy Consistency ✅
```
1. Navigate to Zone Selection (hour: 14)
2. Note: Zone A shows 65% occupied
3. Click Zone A
4. Click back to zone selection
5. Verify: Zone A still shows 65% occupied (not changed!)
6. Select different spots - occupancy stays same ✅
```

### Test 2: Spot Recommendations ✅
```
1. Set hour to 18 (6 PM - peak time)
2. Navigate to Zone A (should be ~75% occupied)
3. Click on any green (available) spot
4. Verify: See recommendation for better zone
5. Click "Switch to Spot X in Zone Y"
6. Verify: Automatically navigate to recommended zone and spot ✅
```

### Test 3: No Recommendations When Not Needed ✅
```
1. Set hour to 2 (2 AM - off-peak)
2. Navigate to any zone (should be ~25% occupied)
3. Click on any spot
4. Verify: NO recommendation shown (zone not busy) ✅
```
