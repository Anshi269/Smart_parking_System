# üß™ Testing the Zone Notification System

## How to Test the Notification

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Test

**Refresh your browser first!** Then follow these exact steps:

#### 1. **Set the Hour to Peak Time**
   - In sidebar, set **Hour to 18** (6:00 PM)
   - This ensures zones will be busy

#### 2. **Navigate to Zone Selection**
   - Click on "Downtown Parking Complex"
   - You should see occupancy % on each zone card
   - **Look for a RED zone** (>75% occupied)

#### 3. **Click the Busy Zone**
   - Click "Select Zone A" (or whichever is most occupied)
   
#### 4. **Check for Notification**
   - **At the TOP** of the slot page, you should see:
     - üîç Debug line showing occupancy
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è RED WARNING BOX if zone is >60% occupied
     - üí° BLUE RECOMMENDATION BOX with alternative spot

---

## üîç What You Should See

### If Notification Appears:
```
üöó Select Parking Slot - Zone A
üîç Debug: This zone is 75% occupied at hour 18

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Zone A is 75% occupied!
Finding a spot here might be difficult. Consider a less crowded alternative.

üí° Smart Recommendation:
Spot 12 in Zone D is a better choice:
- ‚úÖ Only 45% occupied (30% less crowded)
- ‚úÖ 14 spots available (vs 5 here)
- ‚úÖ Distance to exit: 8.5m
- ‚úÖ Easier to find and park

[üöÄ Switch to Spot 12 in Zone D]  [Dismiss & Stay Here]
```

### If NO Notification:
```
üöó Select Parking Slot - Zone A
üîç Debug: This zone is 45% occupied at hour 18

‚úÖ Zone A is only 45% occupied - Plenty of spaces!
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "I don't see the debug line"
**Cause:** Hour not set in sidebar or booking_system not loaded

**Fix:** 
1. Check sidebar - is an hour selected?
2. Refresh the page completely
3. Make sure you see "Loaded 1000 records" in terminal

### Issue 2: "Debug shows low occupancy (like 25%)"
**Cause:** Wrong hour selected (off-peak time)

**Fix:**
1. In sidebar, change hour to **9** (morning rush) or **18** (evening rush)
2. Go back and re-select the zone
3. Should now show higher occupancy

### Issue 3: "Debug shows 65% but no notification"
**Cause:** No other zone is 15%+ less occupied

**Conditions for notification:**
- ‚úÖ Current zone > 60% occupied
- ‚úÖ Another zone exists with 15%+ less occupancy
- ‚úÖ Not dismissed previously

**To check:**
1. Go back to zone selection
2. Look at ALL zone occupancy %
3. Is there a zone with significantly lower %?

### Issue 4: "I see notification once, then it's gone"
**Cause:** You clicked "Dismiss & Stay Here"

**Fix:**
1. Click "Reset Selection" in sidebar
2. Or change the hour slightly (e.g., 18 ‚Üí 17 ‚Üí 18)
3. Navigate back to the zone

## üéØ Guaranteed Test Case

Follow this EXACT sequence to see the notification:

```
1. Refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
2. Sidebar: Set Hour = 18
3. Click parking area
4. Look at zone cards:
   - Find the zone with HIGHEST % (red border)
   - Note its % (e.g., Zone A: 75%)
5. Click that zone
6. üí• You SHOULD see:
   - Debug line at top
   - Red warning box
   - Blue recommendation
   - Two buttons
```

If you don't see it after this, there might be an issue with the hour selection or zone occupancy generation.

## üìä Check Occupancy Levels

To verify zones are actually busy, before selecting a zone:

**On Zone Selection Page:**
```
Zone A: üî¥ 75% occupied  ‚Üê BUSY
Zone B: üü† 62% occupied  ‚Üê BUSY
Zone C: üü¢ 48% occupied  ‚Üê OK
Zone D: üü¢ 35% occupied  ‚Üê OK
```

- **Red zones** (>75%): Should trigger notification
- **Orange zones** (50-75%): Should trigger notification if big difference exists
- **Green zones** (<50%): Should NOT trigger notification

---

## üß™ Test Different Hours

| Hour | Expected Occupancy | Should Trigger? |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 2 AM (2) | ~25% all zones | ‚ùå No (all zones empty) |
| 9 AM (9) | ~75% busy zones | ‚úÖ Yes |
| 2 PM (14) | ~60% busy zones | ‚úÖ Maybe |
| 6 PM (18) | ~75% busy zones | ‚úÖ Yes |
| 11 PM (23) | ~50% busy zones | ‚ö†Ô∏è Maybe |

## üîß Quick Debug Commands

If you want to manually check what's happening:

**Check if booking system is loaded:**
- You should see "Loaded 1000 records" repeating in terminal

**Check current state:**
- Sidebar should show your selected hour
- Zone selection page should show % on cards
- Slot page should show debug line at top

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The notification system is working if:

1. ‚úÖ Debug line appears at top of slot selector
2. ‚úÖ Shows correct occupancy %
3. ‚úÖ Red warning appears when zone >60% AND better alternative exists
4. ‚úÖ Blue recommendation shows specific spot and zone
5. ‚úÖ Buttons work (Switch or Dismiss)
6. ‚úÖ After dismissing, warning doesn't show again for same zone/hour

---

## üìù What to Report

If it's still not working, please tell me:

1. **What hour did you select?** (e.g., 18)
2. **What does the debug line say?** (e.g., "This zone is 75% occupied")
3. **Which zone did you select?** (e.g., Zone A)
4. **Do you see ANY warning/recommendation box?** (Yes/No)
5. **Screenshot if possible**

This will help me identify the exact issue!
