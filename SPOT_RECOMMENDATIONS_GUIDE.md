# 💡 Smart Spot Recommendations - User Guide

## Overview

The parking system now provides **intelligent spot recommendations** when you select a parking spot in a busy zone. This helps you find better alternatives and improves your parking experience!

## 🎯 How It Works

### Recommendation Triggers

The system shows smart recommendations when **ALL** these conditions are met:

1. ✅ **You're in a busy zone** (>60% occupied)
2. ✅ **Better alternative exists** (Another zone with 15%+ less occupancy)
3. ✅ **You've selected a spot** (Click on any green spot)

### What You'll See

When you select a spot in a crowded zone, you'll get a recommendation like this:

```
💡 Smart Recommendation:

Your selected zone Zone A is 75% occupied.

Consider Spot 12 in Zone D instead:
- Only 45% occupied (30% less crowded)
- 14 spots available
- Distance to exit: 8.5m

You can still book your current selection, but this spot might be easier to find!

[🚀 Switch to Spot 12 in Zone D]
```

## 📊 Recommendation Logic

### Step-by-Step Process:

```
1. User selects Spot 15 in Zone A
   ↓
2. Check: Is Zone A busy? (>60%)
   Zone A: 75% occupied ✅
   ↓
3. Find least occupied zone at selected hour
   Zone D: 45% occupied ✅
   ↓
4. Calculate difference: 75% - 45% = 30%
   Is difference > 15%? ✅
   ↓
5. Find BEST spot in Zone D:
   - Get all available spots
   - Sort by proximity to exit
   - Select closest: Spot 12 (8.5m)
   ↓
6. Show recommendation with details
   ↓
7. User can click button to switch automatically
```

## 🎨 Visual Examples

### Example 1: Peak Hour (6:00 PM)

**Scenario:**
- You select Spot 8 in Zone A
- Hour: 18 (6:00 PM)
- Zone A: 75% occupied (busy!)

**Recommendation:**
```
💡 Smart Recommendation:

Your selected zone Zone A is 75% occupied.

Consider Spot 3 in Zone D instead:
- Only 38% occupied (37% less crowded)
- 16 spots available
- Distance to exit: 5.2m

[🚀 Switch to Spot 3 in Zone D]
```

**Click the button** → Automatically navigates to Zone D with Spot 3 selected!

### Example 2: Off-Peak Hour (2:00 AM)

**Scenario:**
- You select Spot 5 in Zone A
- Hour: 2 (2:00 AM)
- Zone A: 22% occupied (not busy)

**Result:**
- ❌ **No recommendation shown** (Zone A is not crowded)
- You can proceed with your selection

### Example 3: All Zones Equally Busy

**Scenario:**
- You select Spot 10 in Zone B
- Hour: 9 (9:00 AM - morning rush)
- Zone B: 74% occupied
- All other zones: 70-75% occupied

**Result:**
- ❌ **No recommendation shown** (No significant better alternative)
- Best to stick with your current selection

## 🧠 Smart Features

### 1. **Best Spot Selection**

The system doesn't just find any available spot - it finds the **best** one:

```python
Criteria for "best spot":
1. Available at selected time ✅
2. Closest to exit 🚪
3. In least crowded zone 🟢
4. Easy to find 📍
```

### 2. **One-Click Switch**

Click the recommendation button and you're automatically:

## 🔧 Technical Details

### When Recommendations Appear

| Condition | Threshold | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Zone occupancy | >60% | Considered "busy" |
| Alternative difference | >15% | Significant improvement |
| Available spots | ≥1 | Must have options |
| Time selected | Yes | Must know when |

### Recommendation Algorithm

```python
def get_recommendation(selected_spot, current_zone, hour):
    # 1. Check if current zone is busy
    current_occ = get_occupancy(current_zone, hour)
    if current_occ <= 60%:
        return None  # No recommendation needed
    
    # 2. Find least occupied zone
    best_zone, best_occ = find_least_occupied(hour)
    
    # 3. Check if significantly better
    if (best_zone == current_zone) or (current_occ - best_occ < 15%):
        return None  # Not worth switching
    
    # 4. Find best spot in better zone
    recommended_spot = get_best_spot(
        zone=best_zone,
        hour=hour,
        criteria='closest_to_exit'
    )
    
    # 5. Return recommendation
    return {
        'spot': recommended_spot,
        'zone': best_zone,
        'occupancy': best_occ,
        'improvement': current_occ - best_occ,
        'details': get_spot_details(recommended_spot)
    }
```

## 💻 Code Integration

The recommendation system is integrated across multiple components:

### 1. BookingSystem (`booking_system.py`)
```python
# New method: get_best_available_spot()
recommended = booking_system.get_best_available_spot(
    section="Zone D",
    hour=18,
    data_loader=data_loader,
    prefer_close_to_exit=True
)
```

### 2. SlotSelector (`slot_selector.py`)
```python
# Triggered when user selects a spot
if current_occupancy > 60:
    show_smart_recommendation()
```

### 3. Session State
```python
# Stores recommendation for display
st.session_state.occupancy_suggestion = {
    'current_zone': 'Zone A',
    'suggested_zone': 'Zone D',
    'recommended_spot': 12
}
```

## 🎨 UI Components

### Recommendation Box

The recommendation appears as a blue info box with:

**Header:**
```
💡 Smart Recommendation:
```

**Content:**
- Current zone and occupancy %
- Recommended spot and zone
- Occupancy comparison

- Available spots count

**Action Button:**

```

## 💡 Tips for Users

### Get the Best Recommendations:

1. **Select your arrival hour first** (in sidebar)
   - Recommendations are time-specific
   - Different hours = different suggestions

2. **Try peak hours to see it in action**
   - Set hour to 9 (morning rush)
   - Set hour to 18 (evening rush)
   - See active recommendations

3. **Compare zones yourself**
   - Check occupancy % on zone cards
   - Recommendations confirm what you see

4. **Trust the system during busy times**
   - Peak hours: Follow recommendations
   - Off-peak: Any spot is fine

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Why don't I see recommendations?"

Possible reasons:
- ✅ Current zone not busy enough (<60%)
- ✅ All zones similarly occupied
- ✅ No alternative with 15%+ improvement
- ✅ Haven't selected a spot yet

### "Recommended spot still looks far"

- Distance shown is to parking lot exit
- Recommendations balance proximity + availability
- You can always stick with original choice

### "Can I see recommendations before selecting?"

- Zone-level: Yes (shown on zone cards)
- Spot-level: Only after selecting a spot
- This ensures context-aware suggestions
