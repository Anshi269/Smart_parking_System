# 🎉 What's New in v1.2.0 - Time-Based Occupancy System

## 🎯 What You Asked For

You wanted the occupancy system to be based on **real-time bookings from other users** (not just historical CSV data), so users can see which slots are actually booked at their selected time.

## ✨ What I Built

### 1. ⏰ Time-Based Booking System

**File**: `src/data/booking_system.py` (New file, 200+ lines)

- Generates **dummy booking data** for all 24 hours × all parking spots
- Simulates realistic parking patterns:
  - **Peak hours** (8-10 AM, 5-7 PM): 75% occupied
  - **Midday** (11 AM-4 PM): 60% occupied  
  - **Evening** (8-10 PM): 50% occupied
  - **Night** (11 PM-6 AM): 25% occupied
- Will be replaced with real database queries later (as you mentioned)

### 2. 📊 Occupancy Percentage on Zone Cards

**Updated**: `src/components/section_selector.py`

Now when you select a zone, you see:

```
┌───────────────────────────┐
│  🅿️ Zone A                │
│  75% Occupied     ← RED   │  
│  5 spots available        │
│  Occupancy: High          │
└───────────────────────────┘
```

**Color-coded borders:**
- 🟢 **Green** (< 50% occupied): Low occupancy
- 🟠 **Orange** (50-75% occupied): Medium occupancy
- 🔴 **Red** (> 75% occupied): High occupancy

**Time Context:**
- Shows "📊 Showing occupancy for **2:00 PM**" at the top
- Changes based on hour selected in sidebar

### 3. 💡 Smart Zone Suggestions

**When you select a busy zone** (>60% occupied), the system automatically suggests a less crowded alternative:

```
⚠️ Zone A is 75% occupied.
Consider Zone B instead - only 45% occupied!

[Switch to Zone B]  [Stay Here]
```

**How it works:**
1. User selects a busy zone
2. System finds the least occupied zone at that time
3. If the difference is >15%, shows suggestion
4. User can click "Switch" to go to better zone instantly

### 4. 🚗 Time-Based Slot Availability

**Updated**: `src/components/slot_selector.py`

**Before:**
- Slots showed occupied/vacant from CSV (static historical data)

**Now:**
- Slots show booking status **for the selected hour**
- User selects 2:00 PM → sees which slots are booked at 2:00 PM
- User selects 10:00 PM → sees different availability pattern
- Red slots = Booked by other users at that time
- Green slots = Available to book at that time

## 🎮 How It Works Now

### User Flow:

```
1. User opens app
   ↓
2. Selects Hour: 18 (6:00 PM) in sidebar
   ↓
3. Navigates to Zone Selection
   ↓
4. Sees:
   Zone A: 🔴 82% occupied (2 spots)
   Zone B: 🟠 68% occupied (8 spots)
   Zone C: 🟢 45% occupied (14 spots)
   Zone D: 🟢 38% occupied (16 spots)
   ↓
5. User clicks "Zone A" (busy zone)
   ↓
6. System shows: "⚠️ Consider Zone D - only 38% occupied!"
   ↓
7. User clicks [Switch to Zone D]
   ↓
8. Zone D slot grid appears
   ↓
9. User sees slots colored based on 6:00 PM bookings
   ↓
10. User selects available (green) slot
```

## 📊 Key Features

### ✅ Occupancy Calculation
```python
# For Zone A at 2:00 PM:
{
  'total_spots': 20,
  'booked_spots': 15,      # From booking system
  'available_spots': 5,
  'occupancy_percentage': 75.0
}
```

### ✅ Realistic Patterns

The system simulates real user behavior:

| Time | Occupancy | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| 9:00 AM | 75% | Morning rush (work) |
| 2:00 PM | 60% | Midday steady |
| 6:00 PM | 75% | Evening rush (leaving work) |
| 11:00 PM | 50% | Some still parked |
| 3:00 AM | 25% | Night - low demand |

### ✅ Database Ready

**Current (Dummy Data):**
```python
bookings = {
    (spot_12, "Zone A", 14): {
        'is_booked': True,
        'booked_by': "User_1234",
        'booking_time': datetime(...)
    }
}
```

**Future (Your Database):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings 
WHERE booking_date = '2024-10-15' 
  AND booking_hour = 14
  AND section = 'Zone A'
```

Just replace `_generate_dummy_bookings()` with `_load_bookings_from_db()` later!

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### BookingSystem Class Methods:

```python
# Check if specific spot is booked
booking_system.is_spot_booked(12, "Zone A", 14)
→ True/False

# Get zone occupancy at specific hour
booking_system.get_section_occupancy("Zone A", 14)
→ {'total_spots': 20, 'booked_spots': 15, ...}

# Get all zones occupancy
booking_system.get_all_sections_occupancy(14)
→ {"Zone A": {...}, "Zone B": {...}, ...}

# Find least crowded zone
booking_system.get_least_occupied_section(14)
→ ("Zone D", 38.5)

# Get available spots only
booking_system.get_available_spots_in_section("Zone A", 14)
→ [1, 5, 8, 12, 15]

# Detect trend (rising/falling)
booking_system.get_occupancy_trend("Zone A", 14)
→ "rising" / "falling" / "stable"
```

- Scalable to real database

## 🚀 Try It Now!

**Restart your app** to see the changes:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Test Scenarios:

1. **Peak Hour Test:**
   - Set hour to 18 (6:00 PM)
   - Go to zone selection
   - See high occupancy (red/orange zones)
   - Select a busy zone → Get suggestion

2. **Off-Peak Test:**
   - Set hour to 3 (3:00 AM)
   - Go to zone selection
   - See low occupancy (all green zones)
   - No suggestions needed

3. **Time Comparison:**
   - Select Zone A at 9:00 AM → See ~75% occupied
   - Back to map
   - Change hour to 3:00 PM → See ~60% occupied
   - Back to map  
   - Change hour to 2:00 AM → See ~25% occupied

## 📊 Data You Can See

Every time you interact with the app, these calculations happen:

```
User selected: 6:00 PM

Zone A: 15/20 spots booked = 75% occupied
Zone B: 13/19 spots booked = 68% occupied
Zone C: 9/20 spots booked = 45% occupied
Zone D: 7/18 spots booked = 38% occupied

Least occupied: Zone D (38%)
Suggestion threshold: >60%

User clicks Zone A (75%) → Show suggestion
```

## 🔮 Ready for Next Phase

This system sets you up perfectly for:

### Phase 3: ML Predictions

```python
# Now you can do:
historical_occupancy = get_occupancy_pattern("Zone A", hour=18)
predicted_occupancy = ml_model.predict(features)

if predicted_occupancy > 0.8:
    suggestion = "High demand expected 5-7 PM; book early"
```

### Phase 4: Personalized Recommendations

```python
# User history analysis:
user_preferences = {
    'prefers': 'spots_near_exit',
    'usual_time': 9,  # 9 AM
    'vehicle': 'Sedan'
}

recommendation = recommend_spot(user_preferences, current_hour)
→ "Recommended: Slot D2 (close to exit, usually free at 9 AM)"
```

## 📝 Summary

### What's Working:

✅ Time-based booking system (dummy data for 24 hours)
